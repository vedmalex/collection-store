## SUMMARY

Phase 3 focused on implementing the Google Sheets Adapter as part of the External Adapters Foundation for Collection Store v6.0. This phase built upon the foundation infrastructure (Phase 1) and MongoDB adapter enhancements (Phase 2) to create a comprehensive Google Sheets integration with sophisticated rate limiting, quota management, and authentication strategies.

- **Google Sheets API Manager** (600+ lines) with comprehensive rate limiting and quota management
- **Main Google Sheets Adapter** (designed but file creation encountered technical challenges)

## REQUIREMENTS

   - Multi-level rate limiting (per second, minute, day)
   - Quota management with daily limits and warning thresholds
   - Request queuing with priority handling
   - Batch operations support
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Data Operations**

  getWaitTime(): number;
}
```

#### Event-Driven Architecture
```typescript
// Event System Integration
class GoogleSheetsAuth extends EventEmitter {
  // Emits: 'authenticated', 'token-refreshed', 'auth-error'
}
