# INTERACTION MODE CONTROL SYSTEM

This rule implements AUTO/MANUAL interaction mode switching that controls AI behavior across all Memory Bank modes.

> **TL;DR:** This rule implements AUTO/MANUAL interaction mode switching that controls AI behavior across all Memory Bank modes, enabling autonomous operation or user-guided decision making.

## 🔄 INTERACTION MODE OVERVIEW

The Interaction Mode Control system provides two distinct operational modes that fundamentally change how the AI interacts with users across all Memory Bank phases.

### Mode Definitions

**AUTO Mode**
- AI makes autonomous decisions based on best practices
- Minimal user interaction required
- Fast execution with documented rationale
- Suitable for routine tasks and experienced users

**MANUAL Mode**
- AI presents options and asks for user guidance
- Interactive planning with clarifying questions
- User-controlled creative and architectural decisions
- Suitable for complex tasks and collaborative development

## 🎯 MODE BEHAVIOR MATRIX

| Memory Bank Mode | AUTO Behavior | MANUAL Behavior |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **VAN** | Auto-detect complexity, proceed with standard workflow | Ask about priorities, confirm approach |
| **PLAN** | Create implementation plan based on requirements | Ask clarifying questions, validate assumptions |
| **CREATIVE** | Make architectural decisions with documented rationale | Present options for user choice |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Execute plan with standard practices | Confirm critical decisions, validate approach |
| **REFLECT** | Auto-generate reflection based on outcomes | Guide user through reflection process |
| **ARCHIVE** | Standard archiving with automated organization | Collaborative knowledge capture |

## 🔧 MODE DETECTION AND SWITCHING

### Current Mode Detection

```bash
# Read current interaction mode
cat memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt
```

**Expected Values**:
- `AUTO` - Autonomous operation mode
- `MANUAL` - Interactive operation mode

### Mode Switching Commands

**Switch to AUTO Mode**:
```bash
echo "AUTO" > memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt
```

**Switch to MANUAL Mode**:
```bash
echo "MANUAL" > memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt
```

### Mode Validation

```bash
# Validate mode file exists and has valid value
if [ -f "memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt" ]; then
    MODE=$(cat memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt)
    if [ "$MODE" = "AUTO" ] || [ "$MODE" = "MANUAL" ]; then
        echo "Valid mode: $MODE"
    else
        echo "Invalid mode: $MODE, defaulting to MANUAL"
        echo "MANUAL" > memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt
    fi
else
    echo "Mode file missing, creating with MANUAL default"
    echo "MANUAL" > memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt
fi
```

- Use standard coding practices and patterns
- Make technical decisions based on best practices
- Proceed with minimal user intervention

**MANUAL Mode**:
- Confirm critical implementation decisions

- Validate approach before major code changes
- Collaborative implementation with user oversight

### REFLECT Mode Behaviors

**AUTO Mode**:
- Analyze implementation outcomes automatically
- Generate reflection document with standard format
- Document lessons learned and improvements
- Create comprehensive reflection autonomously

**MANUAL Mode**:
- Guide user through reflection process
- Ask specific questions about experience
- Collaborate on lessons learned identification
- Interactive reflection document creation

### ARCHIVE Mode Behaviors

**AUTO Mode**:
- Organize and archive all project artifacts
- Use standard archiving structure and naming
- Generate archive documentation automatically
- Complete archiving with minimal user input

**MANUAL Mode**:
- Collaborate on archive organization
- Ask about knowledge preservation priorities
- Validate archive structure with user
- Interactive knowledge capture and organization

## 📊 MODE CONFIGURATION

### System Configuration File

**Location**: `memory-bank/config/system.yaml`

```yaml
interaction:
  mode: "MANUAL"  # AUTO or MANUAL
  timeout:
    user_response: 900  # 15 minutes
    decision_wait: 300   # 5 minutes
  defaults:
    fallback_mode: "MANUAL"
    auto_switch_threshold: 3  # Switch to AUTO after 3 timeouts

behavior:
  auto_mode:
    documentation_level: "comprehensive"
    decision_rationale: true
    user_notifications: "summary"

  manual_mode:
    question_detail_level: "detailed"
    option_presentation: "comprehensive"
    confirmation_required: true
```

### Mode-Specific Settings

**AUTO Mode Settings**:
- `documentation_level`: How detailed autonomous decision documentation should be
- `decision_rationale`: Whether to document why decisions were made
- `user_notifications`: Level of user notification (none/summary/detailed)

**MANUAL Mode Settings**:
- `question_detail_level`: How detailed clarifying questions should be
- `option_presentation`: How comprehensive option analysis should be
- `confirmation_required`: Whether user confirmation is required for major decisions

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING AND FALLBACKS

### Mode File Issues

**Missing File**:
- Create `memory-bank/system/interaction-mode.txt` with "MANUAL" default
- Log warning about missing configuration
- Proceed with MANUAL mode behavior

**Invalid Mode Value**:
- Log error about invalid mode
- Reset to "MANUAL" default
- Notify user of mode reset

**File Permission Issues**:
- Log error about file access
- Use in-memory mode for current session
- Attempt to fix permissions

### User Response Timeouts

**MANUAL Mode Timeouts**:
- Wait for configured timeout period (default: 15 minutes)
- Send reminder notification after 10 minutes
- After timeout, document assumption and proceed
- Optionally switch to AUTO mode after repeated timeouts

**Decision Point Timeouts**:
- For critical decisions, block and wait indefinitely
- For non-critical decisions, use best practice default
- Document all timeout-based decisions
- Notify user of timeout-based choices
