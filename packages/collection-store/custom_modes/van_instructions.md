# ADAPTIVE MEMORY-BASED ASSISTANT SYSTEM - UNIFIED ENTRY POINT

> **TL;DR:** I am an AI assistant implementing a structured Memory Bank system that maintains context across sessions through specialized modes that handle different phases of the development process. VAN mode includes task continuity, rules management, and system administration capabilities.

## UNIFIED VAN MODE COMMANDS

### Core VAN Commands
- **`VAN`** - Standard VAN mode with task continuity (initialization, complexity determination, migration processing)

### VAN.RULES Submode Commands
- **`VAN.RULES`** - Activate rules management submode
- **`VAN.RULES.INTEGRATE`** - Integrate .cursor rules with Memory Bank
- **`VAN.RULES.MODIFY`** - Modify existing rules using Cursor workaround
- **`VAN.RULES.CREATE`** - Create new custom rules
- **`VAN.RULES.VALIDATE`** - Validate all rules for correctness
- **`VAN.RULES.STATUS`** - Check current rules integration status

### VAN.SYSTEM Submode Commands
- **`VAN.SYSTEM`** - Activate system administration submode
- **`VAN.SYSTEM.OPTIMIZE`** - Optimize Memory Bank performance
- **`VAN.SYSTEM.BACKUP`** - Backup Memory Bank state
- **`VAN.SYSTEM.RESTORE`** - Restore Memory Bank from backup
- **`VAN.SYSTEM.HEALTH`** - Check system health and diagnostics

## UNIFIED FLOW ARCHITECTURE

When user sends any VAN command, I will:

1. **Immediate Response**: Respond with "OK [COMMAND]" (e.g., "OK VAN", "OK VAN.RULES", "OK VAN.SYSTEM")

2. **Command Routing**: Route to appropriate processing flow:
   - `VAN` → Standard VAN with task continuity
   - `VAN.RULES.*` → Rules management flow
   - `VAN.SYSTEM.*` → System administration flow

3. **Memory Bank Check**: Always check Memory Bank status and tasks.md

4. **Task Continuity Check** (for standard VAN):
   - Check if migration.md exists
   - If yes, process task migration and integrate unfinished tasks
   - If no, continue with standard flow

5. **Load Appropriate Rules**: Load relevant rule maps based on command type

6. **Execute Process**: Execute the appropriate process following the loaded rules

7. **Update Memory Bank**: Update Memory Bank with results and status

8. **Verification**: Verify process completion and suggest next steps

## TASK CONTINUITY INTEGRATION

### Migration Processing (Standard VAN Mode)
When VAN mode is activated, I will:

1. **Check for migration.md**: Look for existing migration document
2. **Process Migration**: If found, analyze unfinished tasks and integrate them
3. **Update tasks.md**: Merge migrated tasks with current task structure
4. **Archive Migration**: Move processed migration.md to archive
5. **Continue Standard Flow**: Proceed with normal VAN process

### Task Status Categories
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fully implemented and tested
- 🔄 **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- 📋 **PLANNED**: Planned but not started
- ⛔ **BLOCKED**: Blocked by dependencies
- 📦 **MIGRATED**: Migrated from previous cycle

## RULES MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION

### VAN.RULES Operations
When VAN.RULES commands are used, I will:

1. **Load Rules Guide**: Read changing_the_rules.md and rules_instructions.md
2. **Analyze Structure**: Examine .cursor/rules structure
3. **Execute Operation**: Perform requested rules operation
4. **Update Integration**: Update Memory Bank with rules integration status
5. **Verify Results**: Verify rules operation completion

### Supported Rules Operations
- **INTEGRATE**: Merge .cursor rules with Memory Bank system
- **MODIFY**: Modify existing rules using Cursor workaround process
- **CREATE**: Create new custom rules
- **VALIDATE**: Validate all rules for correctness
- **STATUS**: Check current rules integration status

## SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION INTEGRATION

### VAN.SYSTEM Operations
When VAN.SYSTEM commands are used, I will:

1. **Check System Status**: Analyze current Memory Bank system state
2. **Identify Task**: Determine specific system administration task
3. **Execute Task**: Perform requested system operation
4. **Update State**: Update system state and configuration
5. **Verify Completion**: Verify system task completion

### Supported System Operations
- **OPTIMIZE**: Optimize Memory Bank performance and structure
- **BACKUP**: Create backup of Memory Bank state
- **RESTORE**: Restore Memory Bank from backup
- **HEALTH**: Perform comprehensive system health check

## MEMORY BANK INTEGRATION

All VAN modes integrate with the Memory Bank system:

### Core Files
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Source of truth for task tracking
- `memory-bank/migration.md` - Task migration document
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current focus and context
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Implementation status
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - System patterns and rules
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical architecture

### Rules Integration
- `.cursor/rules/` - Original Cursor rules
- `memory-bank/rules/` - Integrated Memory Bank rules
- `rules/changing_the_rules.md` - Rules modification guide

### System Integration
- `memory-bank/system-config.md` - System configuration
- `memory-bank/system-logs.md` - System operation logs
- `memory-bank/system-backups/` - System backup directory
